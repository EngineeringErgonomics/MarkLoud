# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability
- Use GitHub’s **Private Vulnerability Report** feature if available on the repo (preferred).
- If that is unavailable, open a minimal issue titled `Security Disclosure` without details; a maintainer will reach out privately.
- Please do not post exploit details publicly until a fix is released.

## Supported versions
- Latest release (and the current main branch) will receive security patches. Older releases may be fixed on a best-effort basis.
